                            <p> Department of Robotics and automation organised it’s first mega technical “ROBO
                                RACE”. The preparation for which started way before the main day, “The
                                Bharatiyam Day” that is 31st March 2023. <br>
                                The preparation for this mega tech fest started with the brainstorming by the
                                event and technical committee which were led by Nikita Mohapatra and Abhishek
                                Kushwaha respectively with their respective teams. A detailed plan for the event
                                ie. Digital committee led by Dhairya Ghai prepared the posters for the event
                                which were then printed and circulated among the Robotics and Automation
                                engineering students Association (RAESA) members to be circulated to the
                                different departments of the college and also to other college along the message
                                prepared by Magazine committee and the brochure. The poster and message
                                consisted the registration QR code prepared by the Technical committee, the
                                registration amount per team was Rupees 300 INR, with each team getting the ecertificate and winning teams getting trophies and a total cash prize of ₹5000. The
                                brochure was prepared by the technical committee laying down all the technical
                                rules that was required for the robo race few of which were : <br>
                                1. An individual may participate or construct a team of a minimum of 1 and a
                                maximum of 5 members. <br>
                                2. Construct a wired or wireless manual Bot only. The robot must not be made
                                from any ready-made kit, if found so the team will be disqualified. <br>
                                3. Any type of IR, Ultrasonic or any sensor should not be present on robots. <br>
                                4. A bot must fit inside a 30 centimeters wide and 30 centimeters high cube at
                                any point in time. <br>
                                5. Maximum weight should not be more than 3 Kgs (including battery for
                                wirelessly controlled bots. However, a tolerance of 10% is acceptable.).
                                Additionally, the top of the robot must adhere to the standard pattern size
                                and surface constraints. <br>
                                6. Robots must be constructed and programmed in a way that their
                                movement is not limited to only one dimension and must move in all
                                directions <br>
                                After laying down of the rules the dimensions of the Robo race track
                                specifications were included which had a width of 35cm along with many hurdles
                                fixed in its path like Ramp, Marbles, Arc, See Saw, Slope, Rollers and Bridges
                                which were to be overcome in the shortest interval of time in order to win the
                                competition. <br>
                                The most difficult or the challenging part for the Robo race organising team was
                                the making of the Robo track which needed to completed in a stipulated time of
                                only 3 days which started on 27th March 2023 and ended on 29th March 2023. The
                                special credit for making of the Robo track goes to the Robo Track team which
                                included- Tejanshu Dey, Raghav Bhyana, Yadnya Chavan, Abhishek Kushwaha,
                                Dhairya ghai, Sharwin, Ashish, Nishant, Manthan, Shravanti, Pratham Agarwal ,
                                Neeraj Verma and Valid who worked tirelessly to get the work done in stipulated
                                time along with our respected workshop Professors- B.J.Momen, S.D. Patil
                                ,J.A.Gaikwad who along with the guidance also provided with the materials and
                                showed as how to make the track effectively. Without their much needed support
                                it wouldn’t have been possible to complete the work in such a short span of time.
                                After the completion of the track a final planning and meeting was organised on
                                30th March 2023 to discuss the execution of the event on 31st March 2023.
                                31st March 2023, started with the RAESA members coming early in the morning at
                                around 8:00 A.M. to keep the track at its place, placing the registration desks
                                ,making the boundaries of the track and placing the RAESA and Robo Race logos
                                on the track path and along on the stands. At 9:30 the inauguration of the Robo
                                Race official started with our respected Principal ma’am Vidyula Soni , HOD sir Dr.
                                K. B. Sutar and our department professors inaugurating the event. As a part of the
                                inauguration ceremony sir first tested the track and the robot by
                                running the robot on the track. After the inauguration, the teams which had
                                registered for the event came for the competition. A total of 17 teams
                                participated in the Robo Race competition. The teams included Team VIT, Team
                                Akhil, Team Falcon, Team Racing and Team Viking to include a few which came
                                from all over the colleges in Pune and also from our own college. The judging of
                                the performances of the team were done by our faculty professors which
                                included Mr. Ritesh Mahajan sir, Dr. P. V. Jadhav sir, Mr. Beldar sir, Mr. M. J. Patil
                                sir and Mr. Lembhe sir. <br>
                                The first round of the Robo Race was the trial round which was like a warm up
                                round for the teams to check their robots on the track and sustainability of the
                                robots. After the trial of all the robots the actual Robo Race started with the
                                Timers started and teams prepared for the competition to win. One by one as
                                their names were announced the teams came forward and started their robots on
                                the track and tried to complete the track in the minimum time possible to win the
                                competition. Among all the teams the fastest to complete the race and winners
                                were <br> <br>
                                1. Team GDIOT3 from JSPM RSCOE college with completion time 27.77
                                seconds lead by Shubham Shinde <br>
                                2. Team GDIOT1 from JSPM RSCOE college with completion time 35.39

                                of 35.42 seconds lead by Pankaj More. <br> <br>
                                The announcement of the winners were done on the same date and e-certificate
                                was given to all the participants with the 1st and 2nd winners getting the trophy

                                respectively. Photos of the event were clicked and with this we came to the end
                                of the our first ever mega event “ROBO RACE”. We would liked to thank our
                                respected Principal ma’am and our HOD sir for giving us the permission to
                                organize the event on such a large scale along with the our faculty professors who
                                helped in every way possible, the RAESA members and the Track team who
                                helped and coordinated to make the event possible. </p>
